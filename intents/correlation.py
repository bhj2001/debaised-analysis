""" This module contains the correlation intent.
The correlation intent finds the correlation coefficient between 2
columns/metrics.
In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship,
between two random variables or bivariate data. In the broadest sense
correlation is any statistical association, though it commonly refers
to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related.
Madlib :
    Type 1 : "Correlation between <column1> & <column2> where <filters> and
              <date-range>"
    Type 2 : "Correlation between <column1> & <column2> for each <grouping>
              where <filters> and <date-range>"

In Type 1 the result contains only 1 number as the result.
And in Type 2 the result is a table and a correlation coefficient for each
of the groupings.

Correlation value close to +1 means that the 2 variables move in the same
direction with respect to their means. 

Correlation value close to -1 means that the 2 variables move in the opposite
directions with respect to their means. 

Correlation value close to 0 means that the 2 columns are weakly correlated.
